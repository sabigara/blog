## Changesets automates releases to NPM and GitHub Releases

https://github.com/changesets/changesets

I'm currently working on a React component library and it's almost ready for release, but since I have no experience releasing open source libraries on NPM I'm a little confused. Of course, manually running `npm publish` is too tedious and prone to human error. I also want to automate the management of release notes and Git tags.

[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) seemed to solve these problems nicely, so I gave it a try. There is also an [official GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action) provided, and basically you just need to set it up by following the docs, but there are a few caveats. I'd like to write another article about it in more detail.

- The granularity of release notes is not at the commit level, but can be manually managed arbitrarily. I don't know if this is good or not because I have no experience with it. For real example, see [Chakra UI's release notes](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/releases).
- It supports monorepos and it is convenient that it puts individual version tags on each package. I'm using it with pnpm Workspaces and the integration is solid.

## `hidden="until-found"`

https://developer.chrome.com/articles/hidden-until-found/

By manipulating the `hidden="until-found"` attribute from a script, you can easily implement an accessible accordion.

Currently (December 2022), it is not supported by browsers other than Chrome, but it has already been included in the [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#the-hidden-attribute), so it should be supported in the future. While you can use `details` and `summary` to achieve similar things without JavaScript, this attribute can be useful when you want to implement custom one yourself.

## Optimize long tasks

https://web.dev/optimize-long-tasks/

This is a nice post introducing best practices for running time-consuming tasks in the browser.

The basic idea is to divide long tasks into small functions and put them in a queue, and constantly yield to the main thread to prevent screen updates from being blocked.

```js
async function saveSettings() {
  // Create an array of functions to run:
  const tasks = [validateForm, showSpinner, saveToDatabase, updateUI, sendAnalytics]

  // Loop over the tasks:
  while (tasks.length > 0) {
    // Shift the first task off the tasks array:
    const task = tasks.shift()

    // Run the task:
    task()

    // Yield to the main thread:
    await yieldToMain()
  }
}

function yieldToMain() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(resolve, 0)
  })
}
```

It says that you can optimize further by calling the `navigator.scheduling.isInputPending()` API, but this is implemented only in Chrome.

## Thatâ€™s it!
