## Outdent

https://github.com/cspotcode/outdent

JavaScript template literals are useful, but it is inconvenient that they cannot be written in an ugly way in the source code.

For example, when writing a HTML string, you naturally want to write it as follows.

```js
function makeHtml() {
  if (condition) {
    const html = `
    <div>
      <h2>Title<h2>
      <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
    </div>
    `
  }
}
```

However, this includes unnecessary line breaks and indentations, like this:

```js

  <div>
    <h2>Title<h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
  </div>

```

Correctly, it should be written like this (the final line break depends on the case). The deeper the scope nesting, the harder it is to read, and editor completion does not work, making it harder to notice mistakes.

```js
function makeHtml() {
  if (condition) {
    const html = `<div>
  <h2>Title<h2>
  <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
</div>
`
  }
}
```

One way is just including unnecessary line breaks and spaces. However, although this isn't syntax error in languages like HTML, some languages such as Python and YAML depend on indentation as a part of syntax. Even in HTML and CSS, there may be times when you want a pretty format.

[Outdent](https://github.com/cspotcode/outdent) is a convenient library that solves these problems. I found it used in the source code of [Vanilla Extract](vanilla-extract.style) when reading it. If you have a project that needs to write a lot of template literals, you may want to try introducing it.

## React Wrap Balancer

https://react-wrap-balancer.vercel.app/

A React component that automatically adjusts the balance of string wrapping based on the container width. In the following gif, the wrapped second line is almost the same width as the first line, so it looks balanced.

![Comparing two titles with and without React Wrap Balancer](/static/images/blog/react-wrap-balancer.gif)

The API is simple, as follows:

```js
import Balancer from "react-wrap-balancer"

function Title() {
  return (
    <h1>
      <Balancer>My Awesome Title</Balancer>
    </h1>
  )
}
```

Since the docs says it does not cause layout shift, I briefly read the implementation and it seems that it calculates the width and applies it inside `useLayoutEffect`. Therefore, applying it to a very long paragraph may block the screen (although it is "Fast O(log n) algorithm").

It seems useful for responsive layout of landing pages, so I'd like to try it out once.

## How to publish a subdirectory of NPM package

I wanted to publish an NPM package that could be imported from a subpath, like `import Button from "my-package/components/Button"`, so I looked into how to do it.

I was able to achieve this by setting `exports` in `package.json` as follows, which is available since [Node v12.7](https://nodejs.org/es/blog/release/v12.7.0/). Of course, it is also possible to omit the `components/` path.

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "exports": {
    "./components/*": {
      "import": "./dist/components/*/index.js"
    }
  },
  "typesVersions": {
    "*": {
      "components/*": ["./dist/components/*/index.d.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

According to the official documentation, type definitions can be specified in the `types` field within `exports`, but it seems that [this only works when `"moduleResolution": "NodeNext"`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51862#issuecomment-1358049778). Also, placing a `.ts` file within `exports` did not automatically recognize the types. It seems that currently, mapping with `typesVersion` is the appropriate way to go.

## Thatâ€™s it!
