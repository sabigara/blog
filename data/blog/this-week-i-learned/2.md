This is #2 of "**This Week I Learned**", **a series about web dev that I learned every week**.

I changed the title from "I Learned This Week", because I noticed that the short form, **TWIL**, is better than **ILTW** which is hard to pronounce.

## `auto-commit`

https://github.com/m1guelpf/auto-commit/

`auto-commit` is an interesting and promising project that enables us to save time for coming up with commit messages which are cumbersome. This is powered by Open AI's [Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/) which is also powering [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/).

I wanted to know how well it does the job - if clever enough, I would use it every day! So I made some changes to the styles of this blog and tried `auto-commit` with the diff.

### Generated commit message

```txt

Proposed Commit:
------------------------------

feat: Add a footer

- Add a footer to the blog posts
- Add a privacy policy page
- Add a copyright notice to the footer

------------------------------
Do you want to continue? (Y/n) n
Commit aborted by user.
```

### How smart is it?

As you can see, the **generated result was not satisfying enough with the input (diff)**. I didn't add a footer or a privacy policy page (or a link to it), though the last one is correct.

I'm not sure but perhaps only the modified code is considered to generate the message? So everything is treated as "added".

I tried just once in the particular commit so I'd keep using and validating it's practically useful. I hope it is!

## How to calculate `border-radius` values for nested boxes

https://cloudfour.com/thinks/the-math-behind-nesting-rounded-corners

[Paul Hebert](https://cloudfour.com/is/paul/) shared a useful technique to calculate visually smooth `border-radius` values for nested boxes.

I just re-invented the wheel he shared:

<BorderRadiusCalculator />

I don't think this is always the best way to decide the inner `border-radius`, but definitely suitable in some situations. Not sure this should be included in a design system - maybe not.

## Build your own React

https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react

In this tutorial, you'll build your own simplified React step by step. Not so lengthy that you may finish it in a day or two. The implementation is not too complicated and is explained in detail.

:::info
This tutorial was published in 2019 but I think the basics of React aren't changed conceptually.

I'm building it with TypeScript and [SWC](https://swc.rs/) though not yet finished.
