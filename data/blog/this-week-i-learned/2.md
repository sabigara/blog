This is the 2nd issue of "**This Week I Learned**", **a series about web dev that I learned every week**.

I changed the title from "I Learned This Week", because I noticed that the short form, **TWIL**, is better than **ILTW** which is hard to pronounce.

## `auto-commit`

https://github.com/m1guelpf/auto-commit/

`auto-commit` is an interesting and promising project that enables us to save the time for coming up with commit messages which is cumbersome. This is powered by Open AI's [Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/) that is also powering [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/).

I wanted to know how well it does the job - if clever enough, I would use it everyday! So I made some changes to the styles of this blog and tried `auto-commit` with the diff.

### How smart is it?

As you can see, the **generated result was not satisfying enough with the input (diff)**. I didn't add a footer or a privacy policy page (or a link to it), though the last one is correct.

I'm not sure but perhaps only the modified code is considered to generate the message? So everything is treated as "added".

I tried just once in the particular commit so I'd keep using and validating it's practically useful. I hope it is!

## How to calculate nesting rounded corners

https://cloudfour.com/thinks/the-math-behind-nesting-rounded-corners

[Paul Hebert](https://cloudfour.com/is/paul/) shared a useful technique to calculate a visually smooth `border-radius` values for nesting boxes.

I just re-invented the wheel he shared:

<BorderRadiusCalculator />

I don't think this is always the best way to decide the inner `border-radius`, but definitely suitable in some situations. Not sure this should be included in a design system - maybe not.
