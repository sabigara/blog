This is the first issue of "**This Week I Learned**", **a series to share what I learned this week about web development.**. I'll keep experimenting so am not sure what the content will be - even not sure the second issue will come!

Anyway, today, I'd like to share my fresh knowledge about frontend programming and tools.

## Support admonitions in Markdown

:::info
Ever wanted to support this kind of box in your blog or docs?
:::

I did it with `remark` plugins so that I can now write as follows:

```md
:::info
Your message...
:::
```

Learn how in my post: [How to support admonition (or callout) in Markdown](/blog/remark-admonition)

## Contentlayer

I renewed this blog by [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/)

https://www.contentlayer.dev/

**Highlights:**

- No need to dig into the markdown file tree by `fs`
- Triggers Fast Refresh as you edit and save the file - best writing experience!

## Easing Gradients

Sometimes you may notice that the gradient you made with CSS is not smooth. In this case, **Easing** Gradients comes to help you build a `linear-gradient` with easing\*\*.

See the difference between the images below, or play with the editor.

## broz

`broz` is a tiny Electron app that simply opens websites but without browser frames like this:

This will be handy when you take screenshots of websites or record a coding video.

## That's all

I hope you've got something you didn't know from this post!

See you next week...
