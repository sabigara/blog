## `scrollbar-gutter`

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scrollbar-gutter

I encountered an annoying behavior of scrollbar when I was implementing the sidebar of my docs site like this:

![Expanding a section of sidebar is making the scrollbar visible](https://res.craft.do/user/full/a9f7c306-6079-e5df-ecdf-04a17e918d0c/doc/5434F963-7AB3-48D0-94BD-422CE1753AD1/BD27C155-2192-4F06-84CD-6CAA244EF8E2_2/79bdXBKmzZ7sqc8nonBQgdb3V73dhuTUlq3NUd9hxegz/AnimatedImage.gif)

While this may not occur if there are enough contents and everything is expanded by default, I wanted to avoid it if possible.

I learned that `scrollbar-gutter="stable"` does exactly what I want!

I added a single line to my CSS file and it’s done!

## Open Props

https://open-props.style/

CSS Custom Properties (aka CSS variables) is gaining popularity today, as it is Web standard and suitable for design-system-oriented styling. But it’s too difficult and time consuming to build one from scratch.

[Open Props](https://open-props.style/) is an open-source design system that offers a curated list of basic (and advanced) design tokens for Web development, such as colors and font properties.

## React hook internal explained

[React hooks: not magic, just arrays](https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e)

Have you ever wondered how React manages each call of `useState`? I have—as they are merely function calls inside a function, I had no idea why they can “remember” each value.

In the post, [Rudi Yardley](https://medium.com/@ryardley) explained how React stores the state values inside a Component. In shot, **every call of** `useState` **increments a counter and the number decides the index of an array that stores state values (and its setter).**

I think his code is simplified for brevity, but I understood it’s not magic!
