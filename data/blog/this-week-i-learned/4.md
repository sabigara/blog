This is #4 of **This Week I Learned**, **a series to share what I learned this week about web development.**.

Currently, I'm trying to read [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) and found some interesting things.

## Browser ignores `<img loading="lazy" >` attribute if JavaScript is disabled

https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/urls-and-fetching.html#lazy-loading-attributes

> This is an anti-tracking measure, because if a user agent supported lazy loading when scripting is disabled, it would still be possible for a site to track a user's approximate scroll position throughout a session, by strategically placing images in a page's markup such that a server can track how many images are requested and when.

The `loading="lazy"` attribute makes the browser load images only after the image comes into the viewport, so that it's possibly abused to collect the user's behavior even if JavaScript is turned off. HTML Standard does not allow this.

## `"true"` is not a valid boolean value of HTML attribute

https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#boolean-attributes

> If the attribute is present, its value must either be the empty string or a value that is an [ASCII case-insensitive](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive) match for the attribute's canonical name, with no leading or trailing whitespace.
> The values "true" and "false" are not allowed on boolean attributes. To represent a false value, the attribute has to be omitted altogether.

Although developers may know this from experience, some people (like me) don't have concrete knowledge about this. The official spec clearly states that `"true"` and `true` are not valid boolean values. (By the way, these are identical no matter quoted or unquoted. See [A quick introduction to HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/introduction.html#a-quick-introduction-to-html).)

The valid ones are:

```html
<input checked disabled="" required="required" />
```

## Progress bar that shows _real_ progress of `fetch()`

https://tejasq.github.io/basically-streams/examples/fetch/

[Source code](https://github.com/TejasQ/basically-streams/blob/master/examples/fetch/index.js)

I've never needed to implement this kind of feature before, but I will certainly in the future. The code is pretty simple and clear. I want to say thanks to the engineers who made these APIs available.

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://example.com/large.png")

// `response` is a stream!
const reader = response.body.getReader()

// Find out how big the response is.
const length = response.headers.get("Content-Length")

// Initialize how much we've received. Nothing so far.
let received = 0

// What happens when the stream delivers a chunk?
const onReadChunk = (chunk) => {
  // Each chunk has a `done` property. If it's done,
  if (chunk.done) {
    return
  }

  // If it's not done, increment the received variable, and the bar's fill.
  received += chunk.value.length
  barFill.style.width = `${(received / length) * 100}%`

  // Keep reading, and keep doing this AS LONG AS IT'S NOT DONE.
  reader.read().then(onReadChunk)
}

// Do the first read().
reader.read().then(onReadChunk)
```

## Console Ninja

![As you enter search terms, it gets shown beside the console.log call.](https://res.craft.do/user/full/a9f7c306-6079-e5df-ecdf-04a17e918d0c/doc/164E16B0-148F-4832-AFE9-3A4CC21D8ACB/6B0650E4-2C47-4017-990F-94DB65AB517E_2/YkZ5SfWpqoF4MWz2pAugGRAOlggE7jx8f7Hp0YqgaBcz/AnimatedImage.gif)

[Console Ninja](https://console-ninja.com/) is an interesting tool that shows the outputs of `console.log` beside the code line itself!

I'm not sure I really need this but it may be useful in some situations you don't want to open the browser's console.

## Thatâ€™s it!
